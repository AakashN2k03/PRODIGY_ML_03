# Dog and Cat Classification using Machine Learning with SVM

# Overview
This project focuses on classifying images of dogs and cats using machine learning techniques. 
The aim is to build a model that can accurately distinguish between images of dogs and cats and uses support vector machine.
The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a large number of labeled images of dogs and cats.
Due to the large size of the dataset, it is not included in this repository. 
You can download the dataset from the following sources: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats

# Usage
1.Clone the Repository:
Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine.

2.Download the Dataset:
Download the dataset from the specified source and extract it into a directory within the project root.

3.Install Dependencies:
Install all necessary dependencies listed in the requirements file to ensure you have all the tools needed to run the project.

4.Data Preprocessing:
Preprocess the data by resizing the images, converting them to grayscale, and normalizing pixel values. This step is essential to prepare the data for the SVM model.
Train the Model:

5.Train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using the preprocessed data. 
This involves splitting the data into training and validation sets, fitting the SVM model, and tuning any necessary hyperparameters.

6.Evaluate the Model:
Evaluate the model’s performance by calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Visualize the results to understand the model’s effectiveness in classifying dogs and cats.
Make Predictions:

7.Use the trained SVM model to make predictions on new, unseen images. This step allows you to test the model's ability to generalize to new data.

8.Save and Load the Model:
You can wish to save the trained SVM model for future use. This enables you to load the model later to make predictions or to further evaluate its performance without retraining.
